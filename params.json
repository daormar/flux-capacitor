{"name":"Thot","tagline":"Thot toolkit for statistical machine translation","body":"Thot: a Toolkit for Statistical Machine Translation\r\n===================================================\r\nThot is an open source toolkit for statistical machine\r\ntranslation. Originally, Thot incorporated tools to train phrase-based\r\nmodels. The new version of Thot now includes a state-of-the-art\r\nphrase-based translation decoder as well as tools to estimate all of the\r\nmodels involved in the translation process. In addition to this, Thot is\r\nalso able to incrementally update its models in real time after\r\npresenting an individual sentence pair.\r\n\r\nThot is being developed by [Daniel Ortiz-Martínez] [1]. Daniel is a\r\nmember of the [PRHLT research group] [2] at the [Polytechnic University\r\nof Valencia] [3].\r\n\r\n**NEWS: basic usage instructions have been added to the Thot manual**\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\nThe toolkit includes the following features:\r\n\r\n- Phrase-based statistical machine translation decoder\r\n- Computer-aided translation (post-editing and interactive machine translation)\r\n- Incremental estimation of all of the models involved in the translation process\r\n- Robust generation of alignments at phrase-level\r\n- Client-server implementation of the translation functionality\r\n- Single word alignment model estimation using the incremental EM algorithm\r\n- Scalable and parallel model estimation algorithms using Map-Reduce\r\n- Compiles on Unix-like and Windows (using Cygwin) systems\r\n- Integration with the [CasMaCat Workbench] [4] developed in the EU FP7 [CasMaCat project] [5]\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution Details\r\n--------------------\r\nThot has been coded using C, C++ and shell-scripting. Thot is known to\r\ncompile on Unix-like and Windows (using Cygwin) systems. See the\r\n\"Support\" section of this file if you experience problems during\r\ncompilation.\r\n\r\nIt is released under the [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)] [6].\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nTo install Thot, first you need to install the autotools (autoconf,\r\nautoconf-archive, automake and libtool packages in Ubuntu). If you are\r\nplanning to use Thot on a Windows platform, you also need to install the\r\nCygwin environment.\r\n\r\nOnce the autotools are available (as well as Cygwin if required), you\r\ncan proceed with the installation of Thot by following the next sequence\r\nof steps:\r\n\r\n 1. Obtain the package using git:\r\n\r\n        $ git clone https://github.com/daormar/thot.git\r\n\r\n    Or [download it in a zip file] [7]\r\n\r\n 2. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type\r\n    `./reconf`\r\n\r\n 3. Type `./configure` to configure the package\r\n\r\n 4. Type `make` to compile the package\r\n\r\n 5. Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and\r\n    documentation\r\n\r\n 6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source\r\n    code directory by typing `make clean`\r\n\r\nBy default the files are installed under the /usr/local/ directory (or\r\nsimilar, depending of the OS you use); however, since Step 5 requires\r\nroot privileges, another directory can be specified during Step 3 by\r\ntyping:\r\n\r\n     $ configure --prefix=<absolute-installation-path>\r\n\r\nFor example, if \"user1\" wants to install the Thot package in the\r\ndirectory /home/user1/thot, the sequence of commands to execute should be\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     $ ./reconf\r\n     $ configure --prefix=/home/user1/thot\r\n     $ make\r\n     $ make install\r\n\r\nThe installation directory can be the same directory where the Thot\r\npackage was decompressed.\r\n\r\nSee \"INSTALL\" file for more information.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: if Thot is being installed in a PBS cluster (a cluster\r\nproviding `qsub` and other related tools), it is important that the\r\n`configure` script is executed in the main cluster node, so as to\r\nproperly detect the cluster configuration (do not execute it in an\r\ninteractive session).\r\n\r\nInstallation Including the CasMaCat Workbench\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThot can be combined with the CasMacat Workbench that is being developed\r\nin the project of the same name. [See this webpage] [4] to get the specific\r\ninstallation instructions.\r\n\r\nRelation with Existing Software\r\n-------------------------------\r\nDue to the strong focus of Thot on online and incremental learning, it\r\nincludes its own programs to carry out language and translation model\r\nestimation. Specifically, Thot includes tools to work with n-gram\r\nlanguage models based on incrementally updateable sufficient\r\nstatistics. On the other hand, Thot also includes a set of tools and a\r\nwhole software library to estimate IBM 1, IBM 2 and HMM-based word\r\nalignment models. The estimation process can be carried out using batch\r\nand incremental EM algorithms. This functionality is not based on the\r\nstandard GIZA++ software for word alignment model generation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Thot does not use any code from other existing translation\r\ntools such as Moses. In this regard, Thot is a smaller project which\r\ntries to offer its own view of the process of statistical machine\r\ntranslation, with a strong focus on online learning and also\r\nincorporating interactive machine translation functionality.\r\n\r\nCurrent Status\r\n--------------\r\nThe Thot toolkit is under development. Original public versions of Thot\r\ndate back to 2005 [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2005] and were hosted in\r\nSourceForge. These original versions were strongly focused on the\r\nestimation of phrase-based models. By contrast, current version offers\r\nseveral new features that had not been previously incorporated.\r\n\r\nA set of specific tools to ease the process of making SMT experiments\r\nhas been created.  Basic usage instructions have been recently added to\r\nthe Thot manual.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some toolkit extensions that will be\r\nincorporated in the next few months:\r\n\r\n- Virtualized language models (i.e. accessing language model parameters\r\n  from disk).\r\n\r\n- Interpolation of language and translation models.\r\n\r\n- Improved concurrency in the Thot translation server (translation\r\n  process is not still concurrent).\r\n\r\nFinally, here is a list of known issues with the Thot toolkit that are\r\ncurrently being addressed:\r\n\r\n- Phrase model training is based on HMM-based word alignment models\r\n  estimated by means of incremental EM. The current implementation is\r\n  slow and currently constitutes a bottleneck when training phrase\r\n  models from large corpora. One already implemented solution is to\r\n  carry out the estimation in multiple processors. However, we are also\r\n  investigating alternative optimization techniques than allow us to\r\n  efficiently execute the estimation process in a single processor.\r\n\r\n- Log-linear model weight adjustment is carried out by means of the\r\n  downhill simplex algorithm, which is very slow. Downhill simplex will\r\n  be replaced by a more efficient technique.\r\n\r\n- Non-monotonic translation is not yet sufficiently tested, specially\r\n  with complex corpora such as Europarl.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\nProject documentation is being developed. Such documentation include:\r\n\r\n- These instructions.\r\n- The Thot manual (\"thot_manual.pdf\" under the \"doc\" directory).\r\n\r\nIf you need additional help, you can:\r\n\r\n- use the [github issue tracker] [8]\r\n- [send an e-mail to the author] [9]\r\n- join the [CasMaCat support group] [10]\r\n\r\nAdditional information about the theoretical foundations of Thot can be\r\nfound in [Ortiz-Martínez, 2011]. One interesting feature of Thot,\r\nincremental (or online) estimation of statistical models, is also\r\ndescribed in [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2010]. Finally, phrase-level\r\nalignment generation functionality implemented in Thot was proposed in\r\n[Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2008].\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n--------\r\nYou are welcome to use the code under the terms of the license for\r\nresearch or commercial purposes, however please acknowledge its use with\r\na citation:\r\n\r\nDaniel Ortiz-Martínez, Francisco Casacuberta. \r\n*\"The New Thot Toolkit for Fully Automatic and Interactive Statistical Machine Translation\"*.\r\nIn Proc. of the European Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL): System Demonstrations,\r\nGothenburg, Sweden, April 2014. pp. 45-48.\r\n\r\nHere is a BiBTeX entry:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n@InProceedings{Ortiz2014,\r\n  author    = {Daniel Ortiz-Mart\\'{\\i}nez and Francisco Casacuberta},\r\n  title     = {The New Thot Toolkit for Fully Automatic and Interactive Statistical Machine Translation},\r\n  booktitle = {Proc. of the European Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL): System Demonstrations},\r\n  year      = {2014},\r\n  month     = {April},\r\n  address   = {Gothenburg, Sweden},\r\n  pages     = \"45--48\",\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature\r\n----------\r\nDaniel Ortiz-Martínez,\r\n\"*Advances in Fully-Automatic and Interactive Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation*\". \r\nPhD Thesis.
